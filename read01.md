React
What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is used to build single page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components.

How does React Work?

React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

JSX allows us to write HTML in React.

JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() or appendChild() methods.

JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

Rendering Elements (Links to an external site.)
React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called ReactDOM.render().

The ReactDOM.render() function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.

The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.

React Components (Links to an external site.)
All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

When creating a React component, the component’s name must start with an upper case letter.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.

Class components
It requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element.

Function components
It is a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.

React Props (Links to an external site.)
Props are arguments passed into React components.

Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

JSX (Links to an external site.)
It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. (Links to an external site.)
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: (Links to an external site.)
1. how events are handled.
2. how the state changes over time.
3. how the data is prepared for display.
