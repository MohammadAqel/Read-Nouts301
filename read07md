### “ٌRoy Fielding” : He is person helped in writing servers, and gey the pages from the server to our browser.
##### HTTP protocol : is the beginning of the website, tell the browser which type of protocol use.
##### “GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause”.
##### “POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both”.
##### “PUT method is used to update resource available on the server. Typically, it replaces whatever exists at the target URL with something else”.
##### “A patch is a software update comprised code inserted (or patched) into the code of an executable program. Typically, a patch is installed into an existing software program. Patches are often temporary fixes between full releases of a software package”.
### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
##### (Links to an external site.)Hypertext Transfer Protocol: is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access (Links to an external site.)What does a GET do? (Links to an external site.)The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET method requests that the entity be transferred only under the circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client. (Links to an external site.)What does a POST do? (Links to an external site.)The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:
###### - Annotation of existing resources;
###### - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or similar group of articles;
###### - Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process;
###### - Extending a database through an append operation. (Links to an external site.)The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a database. (Links to an external site.)The action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status, depending on whether or not the response includes an entity that describes the result. (Links to an external site.)What does PUT do? (Links to an external site.)The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201 (Created) response. If an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request. If the resource could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an appropriate error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the problem. The recipient of the entity MUST NOT ignore any Content-* (e.g. Content-Range) headers that it does not understand or implement and MUST return a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such cases
##### (Links to an external site.)What does PATCH do?
###### (Links to an external site.)The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.PATCH is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in CRUD (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused).A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource. Contrast this with PUT; which is a complete representation of a resource.A PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be. Contrast this with PUT; which is always idempotent. The word "idempotent" means that any number of repeated, identical requests will leave the resource in the same state. For example if an auto-incrementing counter field is an integral part of the resource, then a PUT will naturally overwrite it (since it overwrites everything), but not necessarily so for PATCH.
##### REST: Roy Fielding, is a guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to browsers. How the web work? The first is the first part of website ,which is the protocol HTTP, tells the browser what protocol to use. That first part is on of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing, Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It’s the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
##### The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to, and a web page is a “representation” of a resource.
##### The URLs tell the browser that there’s a concept, somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.
##### “Web Services” or “APIs” is the way computers use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.
##### “redirect” is the ability to talk to all machines about all the stuff that’s on all the other machines. There are multiple “verbs” the protocol uses to talk to other machines, for example each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PU.
